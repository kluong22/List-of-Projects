<b>List of small and in progress projects hosted on Github:</b>

 Webscraper: Uses Python to collect data from retailer websites

 Brebot: Uses Python/Tweepy to collect all tweet data from a user and attempts to create similar sounding tweets

 NodeJS_practice: Uses Node.JS/MongoDB to host my webscraper data. For some reason I cannot commit current code due to some key files being too big.
